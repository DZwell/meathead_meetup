            <p class="uk-width-medium-4-6 uk-container-center">That's a son of a gun of a cloud. We'll paint one happy little tree right here. Isn't that fantastic that you can create an almighty tree that fast? They say everything looks better with odd numbers of things. But sometimes I put even numbersâ€”just to upset the critics. You don't have to spend all your time thinking about what you're doing, you just let it happen. I really recommend you use odorless thinner or your spouse is gonna run you right out into the yard and you'll be working by yourself.</p>

                <p>If you didn't have baby clouds, you wouldn't have big clouds. All kinds of happy little splashes. We tell people sometimes: we're like drug dealers, come into town and get everybody absolutely addicted to painting. It doesn't take much to get you addicted. Don't hurry. Take your time and enjoy. This is unplanned it really just happens.</p>

                <p>In nature, dead trees are just as normal as live trees. This painting comes right out of your heart. Every highlight needs it's own personal shadow. You can't make a mistake. Anything that happens you can learn to use - and make something beautiful out of it.</p>

                <p>Let's go up in here, and start having some fun This present moment is perfect simply due to the fact you're experiencing it. Now it's beginning to make a little sense. The shadows are just like the highlights, but we're going in the opposite direction. We'll do another happy little painting. Be careful. You can always add more - but you can't take it away</p>
